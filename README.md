# Duke 2019 Datathon - Predicting Customer Conversion Using Multilayer Perceptron Model

"Conversion" represents a reasonable proxy for the number of customers acquired during ad campaigns and also measurements for Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) for advertising companies such as Valassis. By identifying shoppers who are more likely to convert, optimizations can be made on advertisement revenue so returns can be maximized while spending can be minimized. To accomplish this, we use a Multilayer Perceptron with three input layers and two dropout layers (rate of 0.5) in between. An f1 evaluation metric and loss function were used to combat the imbalanced data of customer long-term interests and short-term interests. With this model and several pre-processing methods, we were able to achieve predictions for conversion with 95-96% accuracy.
